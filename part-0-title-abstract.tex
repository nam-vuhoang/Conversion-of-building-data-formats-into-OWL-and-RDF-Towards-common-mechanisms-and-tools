\begin{abstract}
Conversion of building data schemas and sets to OWL ontologies and RDF datasets accordingly is one of the most significant steps to enable Web of Building Data, i.e. sharing and interlinking distributed building information with Web of Data technologies.
So far, building data, including all kinds of information related to the building life cycle, is mainly exchanged in file formats SPF, XML, CSV, and spreadsheets; while their data schemas are specified with EXPRESS or XSD languages.
For instance, IFC (Industry Information Classes) defines an EXPRESS based data model and multiple exchange formats IFC-SPF, IFC-XML, and IFC-ZIP.
In 2015, a group of researchers agreed on the key principles of translating IFC-EXPRESS schema and IFC-SPF datasets into OWL and RDF.
In this paper, I discuss the current IFC-to-RDF conversion mechanism, propose the ways of its optimization, and analyze how to apply similar principles for the XML-based formats, such as COBie, bsDD, InfraXML.
Finally, we introduce our open-source Java conversion software, the central part of which is a dynamic Java entity-relationship model based on both EXPRESS and XSD data models.
By including new plugins, this software allows converting other industrial formats, not only in the built environment.
